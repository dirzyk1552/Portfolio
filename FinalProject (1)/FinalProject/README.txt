## Example Project: Specifications Testing

This example demonstrates how to use the Specifications testing framework to test math operations and email validation in Java.

### Math Operations

The `Calculator` class provides methods for basic math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). These operations are tested using the `Specifications` class to ensure their correctness.

### Email Validation

The `EmailValidator` class uses regular expressions to validate email addresses. The `Specifications` class is used to define and run tests on the email validation functionality.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Code:

2. Run the Tests:

## Test Results

You will see output indicating whether each test expectation was met or not. The summary will display the number of met and total expectations for each test suite.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to use the Specifications testing framework to create and run tests for math operations and email validation. By following the installation and running steps, you can explore how the framework ensures the correctness of the tested functionality.
